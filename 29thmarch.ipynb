    "1. Function: Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the \n",

    "can set some of the coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating some \n",

    "3.Solution Stability: Ridge Regression tends to have a more stable solution than Lasso Regression, especially when\n",
    "the number of features is larger than the number of observations or when there is multicollinearity among the features.\n",
